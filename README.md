# flex-profile

### Your mission, should you choose to accept it.

* Fork this repo. Make _sure_ you're cloning the **forked** version, NOT the original!
* Unless otherwise noted, do not edit the HTML. You should be working in the CSS file! CSS is magic!
* Give the project a Holy Grail layout with flexbox. The divs, with ids, have already been made for you.
* Now rotate that layout by -90 degrees. The header should end up on the left and the navbar at the bottom.
* That sidebar is at the top now, huh. That looks weird, right? See if you can put it back to the right of the main content.
* Let's talk about that content. The GitHub and Email and LinkedIn logos don't lead anywhere. Make them lead somewhere! (You CAN edit the html for this.)
* Put the user profiles in some order. The pictures, username, and bios shouldn't all be on the same line! Back to CSS with this one, please.
